A C++ and Python library for formatting values (numbers, strings, etc.) in
fixed-width fields.  Useful for printing tabular data and similar.

# Setup

### C++

Requires a C++14 compiler.  

Maybe one day I'll try to rewrite it in Rust.

### Python

Requires Python 3.4 or later.

### Google Test

Requires [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) for building
and running the C++ tests:

At the top of the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest
(cd googletest/googletest/make; make)
```
