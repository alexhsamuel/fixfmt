# C++ API

The C++ API provides fixed-width formatters for these types:

- `fixfmt::Bool` for booleans
- `fixfmt::String` for strings
- `fixfmt::Number` for integer and floating-point numbers
- `fixfmt::TickTime` for timestamps represented as UTC epoch timestamps

An instance of one of these classes represents a formatter with fixed
configuration, and will always produce a string of the same width when
formatting any value.  Use the overloaded `operator()` to format a value.

All formatters have a `get_width()` accessor, which returns the formatted width
of any value formatted by that formatter.


## Booleans

For example, the `Bool` formatter with default arguments formats true as `True `
and false as `False`, padding the true value to five characters to match the
length of the false value.

```c++
fixfmt::Bool fmt;
std::cout << "[" << fmt(true) << "]\n"
          << "[" << fmt(false) << "]\n";
```

produces,

```
[True ]
[False]
```

Likewise,

```c++
fixfmt::Bool fmt("ABSOLUTELY", "no");
std::cout << "[" << fmt(true) << "]\n"
          << "[" << fmt(false) << "]\n";
```

produces,

```
[ABSOLUTELY]
[no        ]
```

The constructor's signature is,

```c++
Bool(string const& true_str, string const& false_str, size_t size, bool pad_left)
```

The `size` parameter allows you to specify a fixed width; otherwise the longer
of the length of `true_str` and `false_str` is used.  If `pad_left` is true, the
shorter string is padded on the left instead of on the right.


## Strings

The string formatter formats a string to a fixed width either by _padding_ to
lengthen or _eliding_ to shorten.  Padding consists of adding characters either
to the left or right of the string.  Eliding consists of replacing a sequence of
characters in the beginning, middle, or end of the string with a shorter
_ellipsis_.  

```c++
fixfmt::String fmt(10);
std::cout << "[" << fmt("testing") << "]\n"
          << "[" << fmt("Hello, world!") << "]\n";
```

produces,

```
[testing   ]
[Hello, woâ€¦]
```

Observe that the first string has been padded on the right with three spaces to
achieve a length of 10, while in the second string, the last four characters
have been replaced with a single character, a Unicode ellipsis ("three
periods").  

The constructor's signature is,

```c++
String(int size, string ellipsis, string pad, double position, bool pad_left)
```

`ellipsis` is the ellipsis used for shortening, while `pad` is the pad used for
lengthening.  `position` is the position in the string at which the elision
occurs: 0.0 for the left, 1.0 for the right, or an intermediate number for
elsewhere in the string.  


# Numbers

The number formatter formats a number with a fixed number of digits for each of
the integral and fractional parts, called the "size" and "precision"
respectively.

```c++
double const x = 123.45678;
std::cout << "[" << fixfmt::Number(5, 1)(x) << "]\n"
          << "[" << fixfmt::Number(3, 3)(x) << "]\n";
```

produces

```
[   123.5]
[ 123.457]
```

If the precision is 0, the decimal point is included but without any fractional
digits.  If the precision is `Number::PRECISION_NONE`, the decimal point is
omitted and the number is formatted as an integer.  Numbers are rounded
half-to-even ("bankers' rounding").

```c++
std::cout << "[" << fixfmt::Number(5)(x) << "]\n";
```

produces

```
[   123]
```

Since `Number` has a quite a number of features you can specify, its constructor takes `Number::Args` struct:

```c++
struct fixfmt::Number::Args
{
  int      size           = 8;
  int      precision      = PRECISION_NONE;
  char     sign           = SIGN_NEGATIVE;
  char     pad            = ' ';
  char     point          = '.';
  string   nan            = "NaN";
  string   inf            = "inf";
  char     bad            = '#';
};
```

- `pad` is the character used to pad the integral part to the size, and may be
either `Number::PAD_SPACE` or `Number::PAD_ZERO`.  

- `sign` determines how the sign is presented:

  - `Number::SIGN_NEGATIVE` (the default) reserves one position for the sign, and
    displays a space for positive numbers, a minus sign for negative numbers.  
  - `Number::SIGN_ALWAYS` is similar except that a plus sign is shown for positive
    numbers.
  - `Number::SIGN_NONE` does not reserve a position for the sign; negative numbers
    cannot be formatted.

- `nan` and `inf` are the renderings for NaN and infinite values, respectively.

- `point` is the character used for the decimal point.

- `bad` is a single character that is used to fill the entire width if the number
cannot be formatted, for instance if its integral part exceeds the capacity of
the format size.

Use the C99 struct field initialization syntax to specify the ones you need when creating a `Number`.  For example,

```c++
fixfmt::Number fmt({6, .pad=fixfmt::Number::PAD_ZERO});
```

See the [unit tests](../test/test_number.cc) for additional examples.


# Times

**Note:** This time functionality is a placeholder, and will be redesigned in the future.

The tick time formatter formats UTC times represented as `long` ticks since the
UNIX epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).  A _tick_ is an integral fraction of a
second, generally whole seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds.

The time is formatted in [ISO-8601](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html)
extended time, with a fixed number of decimal digits of precision for the seconds.

```c++
fixfmt::TickTime fmt(fixfmt::TickTime::SCALE_NSEC, 4)
std::cout << "[" << fmt(1447686456947558144l) << "]\n";
```

produces

```
[2015-11-16T15:07:36.9476Z]
```
